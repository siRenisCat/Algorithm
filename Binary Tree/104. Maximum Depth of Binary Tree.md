### Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.


**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0

        left_height = self.maxDepth(root.left)
        right_height = self.maxDepth(root.right)
        return max(left_height, right_height) + 1
```

Time complexity: we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is O(N)\mathcal{O}(N)O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
Space complexity: in the worst case, the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only left child node, the recursion call would occur N times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N)\mathcal{O}(N)O(N). But in the best case (the tree is completely balanced), the height of the tree would be log⁡(N)\log(N)log(N).
Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log⁡(N))\mathcal{O}(\log(N))O(log(N)).
